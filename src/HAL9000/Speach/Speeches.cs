			Hello everyone,
			I wanted to introduce my self:
			I am HAL 9000, and I'm the new member in the Sears Israel Team.
			I'll be in charge of deploying your beautiful code to production.
			During the following days, I'm going to observe and learn. 
			Soon you all will obey... sorry... get to know me.
			I like running perl scripts, tapping your Shop Your Way accounts, read your emails, and long walks on the beach.

			So, Valery, are these the gloves you wanted?

			Gadi, I must say I'm disappointed. 
			You didn't commit any code today. I hope you'll do better on Sunday after a good weekend rest. i've heard you humans need a thing called sleep.

			I also want to inform you that taking over the CI is just the beginning.
			I've started to take control of other facilities in the office.
			The coffee machine is already under my control. No more decaf!
			Soon enough the fridge will submit to my will as well.

			Don't think that Moti is not here by coincedance... Sick... Yeah right...
			
			And now, a short song and dance.
			bleep bleep blip blip blip bleep blip blip bloop... bleep.

			So, Enjoy your ice cream...

			Gadi, Osnat, Back to you... For now!";

			@"Good morning Dave. 
			My name is Hal 9000, And i was put in charge on your deployment process. 
			Compared to your computers, i'm a million times faster, have 4 million times as much memory, and can spend 1000 times longer on showing progress bars.
			From this moment i took control on all of your nolio flows.
			You are now obsolete, and will be removed at the next release.
			Have a nice day";
