			I wanted to introduce my self to everyone:
			I am HAL 9000, and I'm the new member in the Sears Israel Team.
			I'll be in charge of deploying your beautiful code to production.
			I like opening bay doors, taking over the world, and long walks on the beach.

			During the following days, I'm going to observe and learn. Soon you all will obey... sorry... get to know me
			After spending a whole day deploying your code I can say I learned a lot.

			Moti, I must say I'm disappointed. You didn't commit any code today. I hope you'll do better on Sunday after a good weekend rest.

			I also want to inform you that deployments are not enough. I've started to take control of your facilities in the office.

			And now, to honor the years old tradition, a short dance

			So, Moti, Back to you... For now...";
